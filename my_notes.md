# My Notes

## BASH useful commands
`tr` - translate

`&` - put at the end of a command to send to background

`man` - view manual for a command

`sort` - use `-t` to define a delimeter, use `-k` to define segment/key (column) to sort on

## Reference alignment 
- Mismtach threshold for viral sequences? Stick with defaults unless your sample is very divergent from reference
- Coverage/depth:
  - Coverage = how many reads cover a specific position - often averaged over the genome
  - Breadth = how much of genome covered
  -
